# GREVocab
This is a repository containing the Vocabulary word-lists I had prepared for my GRE preparation.

# Some Notes Regarding the Uploaded Material
1. The uploaded lists contain words I came across while preparing for the Verbal Reasoning sections of GRE.
2. The words have been assembled from various sources including my casual reading material, newspaper articles (The New York Times, The Guardian, etc.), movies I watched, and so on. There is also a list of important words from all the Norman Lewis sessions.
3. I have manually typed and prepared this material, hence there is a scope of errors in the form of typos and repetitions; more the repetitions, the more difficult it was for me to remember that word :)
